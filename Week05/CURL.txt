Week 5 Lecture 1 - CURL
I have saved below the commands run to complete lab 1 CURL.

Type the following commands on command line

To view the entire webpage:
curl http://andrewbeatty1.pythonanywhere.com/books

To view the header and response code
curl -i http://andrewbeatty1.pythonanywhere.com/books

To view just one book:
curl http://andrewbeatty1.pythonanywhere.com/books

Adding a book (note the way the quotation marks have to be escaped):
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST -d "{\"Title\":\"xxx\",\"Author\":\"xxx\", \"Price\":3000}" http://andrewbeatty1.pythonanywhere.com/books
result - {"Author":"xxx","Price":3000,"Title":"xxx","id":49}

Updating book 49 that I just created:
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X PUT -d "{\"Price\":2000}" http://andrewbeatty1.pythonanywhere.com/books/49

Deleting the book I made:
curl -X DELETE http://andrewbeatty1.pythonanywhere.com/books/49
