create a new table in database 
mysql> create table student(
    -> id int NOT NULL auto_increment,
    -> firstname varchar(100),
    -> age int(3),
    -> PRIMARY KEY(id)
    -> );

mysql> insert into student (firstname,age) values ('joe', 56);

mysql> select * from student;

mysql> update student set firstname='mary' where id = 1;

mysql> Delete from student where id = 1;

Make sure you do not forget the semi colon (;) if you are stuck in the middle of a command use ctrl-c

Make a table called book that has 4 columns (id, title, author, price) and insert some data
into it.

mysql> create table books(
    -> id int NOT NULL auto_increment,
    -> title varchar(100),
    -> author varchar(100),
    -> price int(3),
    -> PRIMARY KEY(id)
    -> );

mysql> insert into books (title,author,price) values ('test','test', 123);

mysql> select * from books;

Look at the tables in phpmyadmin.
